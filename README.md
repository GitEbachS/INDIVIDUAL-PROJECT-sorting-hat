 #Get Started!
 ## About the User
 - The ideal user would be a student who is interested in being a part of a sorting game.
 - The user gets added to one of Hogwart's houses where there will be other students wearing hats, as well.
 - The user can expel those students he/she believes are not on Hogwart's side, and they will be expelled from the houses.
 - The expelled students will be added to Voldemort's Army

# Features
- The page shows filter buttons at the top where the user can view which house and color contains which students.
- The user can click the button to create a form and enter their name in the form. They will be created as a new object and pushed to the students array.
- They will be randomized as an object, and given a color and house.
- Voldemort's Army is created by using a separate array of cards that gets pushed to another container.
